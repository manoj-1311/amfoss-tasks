This task involves reassembling a treasure map from fragmented "Biome Scans" images.
 Each image depicts a Minecraft block type, and the goal is to:
1. Sort the images in numerical order.
2. Identify the main block in each image using OpenCV.
3. Calculate the average color and central coordinates of each block.
4. Construct a larger output image using Pillow.
5. Plot each block at its calculated coordinates using its average color.
6. Draw lines between consecutive blocks, colored based on the starting block.
Tools i Used 
1. OpenCV: For image loading, manipulation, and object detection.
2. Pillow: For creating and manipulating the output image.
3. Python: The programming language used for the task.
Key Skills
1. Image processing and analysis.
2. Object detection and color analysis.
3. Geometric transformations and drawing primitives.
4. Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.
