The first command i used for this task is " git clone https://github.com/KshitijThareja/TheCommandLineCup.git" for cloning into terminal.
I Make folders by using mkdir codes.
I solved the problems to Navigate directories cd into required folders like 0x, 0y.
I used to Run Python spells like python3 Spell_name.py to access the python files.
I Save codes by using echo "<code>" > codes/Part_x.txt
I Copy spell files by cp Spell_name.py codes/
I Check branches like git branch -a
Fetch single file from branch by using these commands git checkout <remote_branch> <path/to/file>
Combine & decode final code â†’ cat Part_*.txt > finalcode.txt && echo <base64code> | base64 --decode
