I picked a random 10 css daily battle puzzle 
I solved it through css
I used internal and external css for solving these task
I only used div tag as mentioned in the instructions
I select the no of divs by seeing the picture 
I used style tag for styling the divs.
This battle helps me understand the html tags and css styling.
I used margin tag to fix the area.
I also used the tags padding , center-align , borderradius etc.
